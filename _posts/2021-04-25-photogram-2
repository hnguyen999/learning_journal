3.  rails g devise user [automate the basic User RCAV for us] additional_input1 additional_input2 additional_input3 (additional input we want to include in the model)
   
    rails g devise:views
Run in terminal: to create view templates for the Users folder
Devise gem included the basic sign in, sign out, edit forms ---- when we want to customize how they look (and add Bootstrap), we'll run the above rails command and then go into each 
example: views > users> passwords > view.html.erb -----> make it look nice manually (you can copy/paste code or run rails g draft:devise === Raghu created a generator for some nice custom templates)
