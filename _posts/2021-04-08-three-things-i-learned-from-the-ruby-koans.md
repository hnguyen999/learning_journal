title: Three things I learned from The Ruby Koans
---

Here are (at least) three things I learned from [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/):

In class on 4/8/21, I learned that you can commit to GitHub directly by navigating to the folders in my repository and commit below. 

I can do the same in Gitpod's terminal and the command is always git add -A; git commit -m. If I make commits in Gitpod, I will also need to push them to GitHub.
